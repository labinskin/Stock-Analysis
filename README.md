# Green Stocks Analysis

By Nicholas Labinski

### Background

Steve had asked me to write VBA code to help him analyze green stocks that his parents have invested in, as well as other potential green stocks. I initially analyzed the DQ stock for Steve. However, after this analysis, he wanted to be able to analyze the total volume and return percentage of other green stocks. I have written code to help him analyze both DQ and other stocks, and he has been appreciative of the work I have done for him. However, he wanted to be able to analyze the entire dataset, and possibly larger datasets in the future, with the click of a button. Because of this expansion in size of the dataset(s), my code will have to be updated to work as quickly and efficiently as possible, as the current code might not be able to handle the volume of data. The solution to this problem is to refactor my original code, making it more efficient and taking less time to run, especially with an expanded dataset.

### Results



### Summary

**Benefits**

The benefits of refactoring code are many. In this particular case, the code became simpler and more efficient, allowing it to run faster. For 2017, the code ran .711 seconds faster (see images below). For 2018, the code ran .6953 seconds faster (see images below).

Insert Images

While these mere fractions of a second don't seem like much for this current dataset, the differences would likely be larger with expanded and larger datasets.
